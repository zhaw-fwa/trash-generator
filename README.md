# Trash Generator
Generates randomized toy examples of food waste ðŸ—‘.

As a temporary measure so that we can work on development even before any real data has arrived, we have decided to make a trash generation program.
The goal is to randomly generate images of trash cans with food waste in them, along with the required annotations.
The images themselves will be relatively simple, consisting mostly of patterns and lines representing different foodstuff.

This generates an arbitrary number of image sequences, with each image sequence having arbitrary length as defined by the user or chosen randomly.

## Running the generator
The generator can be run from the command line.

```bash
python3 dataset_generator.py DIR CSV N [LENGTH] [--height val] [--width val]
```

- `DIR` is the where the dataset should be output to. If it is not empty, its contents will be overwritten.
- `CSV` is the classes csv file. A default version is included in this repo under `src/classes.csv`.
- `N` is the number of image sequences to generate.
- `LENGTH` is the length of each image sequence. If none is given, then a random length between 0 and 50 will be chosen
  e.g. if `val` is 20, `N` is 6, and `LENGTH` is 8, then the 3rd image sequence will only have 4 images. 
- `--height` is an optional height argument. This specifies the height of the generated image. Defaults to 800. 
- `--width` is an optional width argument. This specifies the width of the generated image. Defaults to 1024.

## Requirements
- numpy~=1.18
- Pillow==7.0
- scipy==1.4.1
- scikit-image~=0.16
- tqdm

## Annotation Schema
This dataset uses a custom annotation style.

### `annotations.json` Example
```json
{
  "categories": 
  {
    "1": {"super_category": "fruit", "category": "banana", "avoidable": false}
  },
  "images": 
  {
    "2019-09-18-10-34-29.jpg": 
    {
      "new_obj_mask": "new_object_masks/2020-09-18-10-34-29.png",
      "top_20_mask": "top_20_masks/2020-09-18-10-34-29.png",
      "prev_image": null,
      "next_image": "2019-09-18-10-34-43.jpg"
    }
  }
}
```

The category keys here corresponds with the luminosity value in the corresponding 8-bit top_20 segmentation mask. 


## Examples
Here are some examples of the results of this tool for image sequences of length 9

## Color scheme
A hand-picked color scheme was chosen for the color of the objects inside the bin to make them have colors that are more analogous to items that may be found in trash bins.
For example, the colors are more muted and more similar to each other.
The final chosen color scheme uses the following colors.

The color scheme was generated using the the script `trash_generator/color_generator.py`. 

## To Future Users and Contributors
In case you need to modify code or understand how it works, here's the flow of the code.

1. `dataset_generator.py` is run. Inside this file, the function `generate_dataset()` is called.
2. `generate_dataset()` figures out the required parameters of the dataset to be generated.
3. `generate_dataset()` then creates a `BinSequence` instance, which can be found in `trash_generator/bin_sequence.py`.
4. `BinSequence` first generates a random rubbish bin image in its `_randomize_bin()` method, which calls the `generate_bin()` function in the file `trash_generator/bin_generator.py`.
5. `BinSequence` also creates a `TrashGenerator` instance, which creates the random shapes necessary to fill the bin with.
6. `TrashGenerator` is a class that can be found in `trash_generator/trash_gen.py`.
7. `TrashGenerator` uses the `classes.csv` file to figure out what each class should be shaped like and how they behave.
8. `BinSequence` also determines the colors for the classes. They are hard-coded as hex strings with the variable name `self.class_colors`.
    1. The color of the bin, its inside, and the background are randomly selected by a possible range of colors in `BinGenerator`'s `_choose_colors()` method.
9. Once the initialization is completed, `generate_dataset()` calls the `generate_sequence()` method of `BinSequence`, which generates a sequence of images and their corresponding ground truths.
   The actual trash sequence is rendered by the `_render()` method, which also adds various noise into the image.
10. Finally, `generate_dataset()` receives the generated images and generates the actual annotation and file structure required.
