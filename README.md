# Trash Generator
Generates randomized toy examples of food waste ðŸ—‘.

As a stop-gap measure so that we can work on development even before any real data has arrived, we have decided to make a trash generation program.
The goal is to randomly generate images of trash cans with food waste in them, along with the required annotations.
The images themselves will be very simple, consisting mostly of solid colors and lines as well as simple patterns representing different foodstuff.

This generates an arbitrary number of image sequences, with each image sequence having arbitrary length as defined by the user or chosen randomly.

A simple GUI as well as a command line interface is available to run the program.

## To Dos
- [ ] Create background trash cans
- [ ] Crate/find food patterns
- [x] Implement random blob generator
- [ ] Implement image sequence generator
- [ ] Implement command line interface
